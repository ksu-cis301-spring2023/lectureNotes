Suppose we have the following predicates:

P(x, y): person x is partners with person y
CS(x): person x is a CS major
ECE(x): person x is an ECE major
KS(x): person x is from Kansas


For each statement:
a) Translate it to English
b) Negate it, showing your work (any OR statement should be converted to an ->)
c) Translate your negation to English




1. ∀ x (KS(x) V ¬CS(x))






2. ∃ x (ECE(x) ^ ∀ y (KS(y) → P(x, y)))
