Suppose we have the following predicates:
    P(x, y): person x is partners with person y
    CS(x): person x is a CS major
    ECE(x): person x is an ECE major
    KS(x): person x is from Kansas

For each statement:
Translate it to English, Negate it, showing your work (any OR statement should be
    converted to an ->),  Translate your negation to English

1. ∀ x (KS(x) V ¬CS(x))

Translation: All people are from KS or are not CS majors
(This is equivalent to: Every CS major lives in KS)

Negation:
    !(∀ x (KS(x) V ¬CS(x)))
    E x !(KS(x) V ¬CS(x)))
    E x (!KS(x) ^ CS(x))

Translation of negation: There is a person who is not from KS and is a CS major


2. ∃ x (ECE(x) ^ ∀ y (KS(y) → P(x, y)))

Translation: There exists an ECE major who is partners with all people who are from KS

Negation:
    !( ∃ x (ECE(x) ^ ∀ y (KS(y) → P(x, y))))
    A x !(ECE(x) ^ ∀ y (KS(y) → P(x, y))))
    A x (!ECE(X) V !( ∀ y (KS(y) → P(x, y))))
    A x (!ECE(X) V E y !(KS(y) → P(x, y))))
    A x (!ECE(X) V E y !(!KS(y) V P(x, y))))
    A x (!ECE(X) V (E y KS(y) ^ !P(x, y))))
    A x (ECE(X) -> (E y KS(y) ^ !P(x, y))))

Translation of negation: For all ECE majors, there is a person who are from KS and isn't their partner
(Every ECE major has someone who is from KS and is not partners with them)
