Use truth tables to prove that the following argument is valid.

Premises: p → q, q → ¬r
Conclusion: p → ¬r

want to show that whenever all the premises are true, then the
conclusion is also true

Explain from your results why we know the argument is valid.

p q r | p->q    |   q → ¬r      |  p → ¬r
------------------------------------------
T T T |  T            F F            F
T T F |  T            T T            T
T F T |  F            T F            F
T F F |  F            T T            T
F T T |  T            F F            T
F T F |  T            T T            T
F F T |  T            T F            T
F F F |  T            T T            T

The set of truth assignments that make each premise true are: [T T F] [F T F] [F F T] [F F F]
All of those truth assignments also make the conclusion true, so the argument is valid.



(Reminder: what would we need to do to show an argument is INVALID?)

An argument would be invalid if we find ONE truth assignment where all premises are true but
conclusion is false.
