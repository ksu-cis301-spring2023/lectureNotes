1. Use set builder notation to describe the set 1, 3, 9, 27, etc.






2. List the elements in the set {x : x = 2k, k ∈ ℤ} ∩ B, where B is defined
by the following recursive definition:

    2, 7 ∈ B
    If x, y ∈ B and x + y ≤ 20, then x + y ∈ B




3. What can we say about sets A and B if we know:
    a) A ∪ b = A?


    b) A - B = A?


    c) A - B = B - A?


    d) A ∩ B = A?


    e) A ∩ B = B ∩ A
